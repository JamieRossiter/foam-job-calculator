### Background
Clark Rubber is an Australian retail icon with 60 stores nationally. Every year, Clark Rubber stores serve thousands of customers in need of foam and upholstery products and services, including but not limited to couch, bench and seat cushion replacements.

Employees at Clark Rubber's Nunwading branch noted that their existing quotation process for foam and upholstery was slow, complicated and disruptive. It required employees to manually calculate lots of individual figures. This resulted in a reduction in employee productivity and customer turnover, negatively impacting the business financially.

### Description
This web application was developed to streamline the foam and upholstery quotation process at the Nunawading store. Built with ReactJS, the application presents a simple-to-navigate user interface and an intuitive step-by-step user experience designed to be used by tech-savvy and tech-illiterate alike. 

### Impact
The introduction of this tool reportedly increased employee productivity and customer satisfaction at the Nunawading store as employees were able to generate quotations far quicker than their previous manual method. This was especially true for customers requiring larger quotations that included 5 or more cushions.
